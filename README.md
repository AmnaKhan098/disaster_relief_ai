# DisasterRelief AI 🌍🚨

**DisasterRelief AI** is an intelligent decision-support system designed to assist emergency response organizations in identifying and prioritizing the most severely affected areas during a disaster. By leveraging AI and geospatial data, it helps optimize the delivery of emergency supplies to regions that need them most—faster and smarter.

## 💡 Key Features

- 📍 **Real-time Map Visualization** – Displays disaster-impacted zones on an interactive map.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Area Prioritization** – Uses severity data to rank regions by urgency.
- 🚑 **Supports Emergency Response Teams** – Enables better planning and quicker action during crises.
- 🧠 **Scalable & Modular Architecture** – Can be extended to multiple disaster types (floods, earthquakes, etc.)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React / Mapbox / Leaflet (for interactive maps)
- **Backend**: Python / Flask or FastAPI
- **AI/ML**: Pre-trained models for damage severity assessment (image or text-based)
- **APIs & Data**: Satellite imagery APIs, disaster data feeds (e.g., NASA, UN OCHA)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit / Docker (optional)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects real-time disaster data (e.g., satellite images, reports).
2. **Analysis**: Applies AI models to assess severity levels in different areas.
3. **Mapping**: Visualizes affected zones on an interactive map with priority indicators.
4. **Actionable Output**: Recommends areas to prioritize for emergency supply distribution.
